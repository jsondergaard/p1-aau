### Makefile ###

The overall build process is controlled by the master `Makefile`.  It provides
the following commands:

	make
	make release

Generate the CMake build files for use or distribution.  Once complete you will
need to change to the `build` directory and run `make`, `make test`, and
`cpack` as desired.

	make zip

Direct CPack to create a zip installer rather than a graphical installer.

	make debug

Generate build files for [CuTest] unit testing.  In the `build` directory, 
run `make`, then `make test`.

	make analyze

If you have `clang` installed, this will generate debug build files with the
`scan-build` command.  In the `build` directory, run `scan-build -V make`
to compile the software and view the static analysis results.

	make xcode

Build a project file for Xcode on OS X.

	make windows
	make windows-zip
	make windows-32
	make windows-zip-32

Use the MinGW software to cross-compile for Windows on a *nix machine.  You can
specify the 32 bit option, and also the zip option as indicated.

	make documentation

Build the [Doxygen]-generated documentation.

	make clean

Clean out the `build` directory.  Be sure to run this before running another
command.
